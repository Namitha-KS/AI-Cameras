This algorithm can develop an innovative and intelligent in-car safety system that can detect potential dangerous situations caused by driver drowsiness or intoxication. The system must be capable of real-time pupil dilation monitoring to detect signs of drowsiness and track eye behavior for signs of intoxication, ensuring the safety of both the driver and passengers.

AI-powered Driver Safety System that integrates advanced computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence to analyze the driver's eye behavior and detect possible signs of drowsiness or intoxication. The system will be installed discreetly in the car's dashboard and integrated with the onboard camera.

Detecting whether a person falls asleep or if their pupils are dilated solely based on the webcam feed is a challenging task that requires more advanced algorithms and potentially machine learning models. It is important to note that pupil dilation detection often involves more sophisticated computer vision techniques and specialized equipment. This code will not be able to accurately determine if a person is falling asleep or if their pupils are dilated. It serves as a starting point for further development and improvement, and more advanced algorithms and models would be necessary for reliable sleep detection or pupil dilation measurement.
